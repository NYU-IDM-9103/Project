# Milestone 1: Ideation and High-Level Description

### Option 1
Destroying optimality

I wanted to critique the obsession with perfection and optimization in technology, especially in ML algorithms, which is usually related to either some form of accuracy or efficiency. Destroying it would allow the artist to reveal the machine's "flaws" in a way, maybe humanize its outputs, or highlight the subjectivity of what we consider "ideal". A more philosophical question would then be: if ML models are not striving for perfection, are they still fulfilling their purpose? Partly inspired by glitchy typewriter example from the first code translation homework. 

Some ideas include:
- Corrupting training data by feeding incomplete, conflicting, or nonsensical data to disrupt the learning process
- Randomly modifying hyperparameters during tuning
- Extract the outputs from intermediate layers of neural networks
